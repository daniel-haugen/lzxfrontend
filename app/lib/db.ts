The perfect post-processor for your analog textures. Dedicated Digital Hardware Not just just a computer hiding behind the control panel. Dedicated FPGA blocks provide hardware acceleration for powerful real time video processing. Flexible video outputs include 1V YRGB, Composite, S-Video, and DVI-D connections. Performance Focused Controls 13 voltage controlled parameters with CV input attenuators and high quality faders for accurate positioning and smooth transitions. 13 broadcast-style illuminated pushbutton controls for satisfying button mashing. In frame buffer feedback mode, spatial effects are placed in the feedback path between the keyer and frame buffer memory. The video feed is mapped and multiplied across space and time into endless universes of recursive transformation. Memory Palace's painting mode allows you to draw onto the digital memory canvas using external shapes, patterns or even video sources as your paintbrush. Designed for use with the LZX Escher Sketch stylus pad controller or any voltage control source that generates XY voltages. Spatial Processor Functions Memory Palace's spatial processor is modeled after classic broadcast Digital Video Effects (DVE) processors from the 1980's and 1990's. The spatial processor uses digital frame memory to reinterpret the input image, adjusting its positioning, size, aspect ratio, and rotation angle in a nonlinear fashion. Multiple selectable modes: Feedback mode places the spatial effects in the processing chain after the keyer. Painting mode places the spatial effects on the input before the keyer. X & Y Position displace the input image horizontally and vertically. Zoom scales the size of the input image larger or smaller than its original size. Stretch adjusts the horizontal / vertical aspect ratio of the image. Rotation rotates the entire image 360 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise. Tile mode repeats the buffer image multiple times depending on Zoom and Stretch settings. Kaleidoscopic effects are possible when combined with the rotation control. Mosaic mode allows extension of the effects beyond the borders of the input frame. Mirror X & Mirror Y functions mirror the entire image across the horizontal and vertical axes. X & Y Scroll functions enable continuous movement of the image in any direction, with sliders controlling movement speed. Spin function enables continuous clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the image with the slider controlling spinning speed. Soft Keyer Functions Memory Palace's soft keyer allows smooth linear transitions from the incoming video and the image stored in the internal video frame buffer. It may source its key mask from luma and chroma keying modes, or may also be used as an alpha channel processor for external ramp gradients and keys. Multiple selectable modes: Luma Key, Chroma Key, Alpha Processor, and Window Key. Threshold controls the cutoff of the internal key generator, with behavior determined by the selected keyer mode. Softness controls the softness of the key edge used when compositing the buffer with the incoming image. Color Processor Functions Memory Palace's color processor can function as a video proc-amp or psychedelic colorizer. When used in feedback mode, it serves as a way to modify each repeat of the buffer image incrementally, creating seamless gradients across time. Multiple selectable modes: Proc Amp, Colorize. Hue controls a shift in the angle of the image's hue, without effecting brightness or saturation. Cycle mode allows hue to shift continuously, with the Hue slider setting the speed of color rotation. Saturation controls an increment or decrement of the image's saturation level. In a feedback loop, it can gradually saturate or desaturate an image with each successive pass. Frame Buffer Memory Functions Memory Palace includes uncompressed video memory which stores a stack of the most recent frames it has processed. Delay selects the number of frames to delay the image within its feedback loop, allowing complex echoing. While the image is frozen, delay can be used to scan the output across frames in the recent past using the slider or external voltage control. [Designer Note: We have not yet determined the maximum length of frame delay, but it will likely be 2-3 seconds. Since the delay reiterates into the buffer, the actual visual effect of the delay is much longer across time.] Feedback controls the amplitude of the buffer memory as it is fed back into the background of the Soft Keyer. Above its center point, the image will blow out to white, and below its center point, the image will fade to black. Freeze button freezes the entire buffer, disabling any writing into it. The frozen image will be held at the output until the frame is unfrozen. Freeze frames can be strobed with the external trigger input. Clear button clears the image to black. Useful in painting mode when you want to erase the current drawing and start a new one. Front Interface DVI-D/HDMI video output supporting 480p/576p SD progressive output. DVI-D to HDMI connector adapter included. [Designer Note: We plan to enable other output video format options on the DVI-D connector.] USB input for firmware update and future expansion. Composite & S-Video (Y/C) video output supporting 480i/576i SD modes. Five 1V DC patchable video inputs for Aux, Alpha, Red, Green & Blue channels at 480i/576i SD resolutions. The alpha input is an external soft key input for external masks and shapes, and the aux channel may be used as a modulation source. Four 1V DC patchable video outputs for Luma, Red, Green & Blue channels at 480i/576i SD resolutions. All video inputs and outputs can be used simultaneously.

      "description": "Currently not available.The first in our logic series. Extremely fast CMOS logic with high speed comparators on all inputs. Used for boolean logic operations on any type or frequency of input. Logic circuits are capable of pixel rate switching. A familiar arrangement for many modular synthesizers, the module includes two Boolean circuits with AND/OR/XOR outs and two logic inverters. With video logic and even just a couple simple sources, it's easy to turn a relatively simple pattern into many complex geometrically related outputs. Video logic is a high speed digital logic processing module with multiple boolean and inversion functions. It is capable of logical combinations of video rate signals throughout the video bandwidth. Each of the eight inputs includes a high speed comparator which converts any input signal into key logic around a threshold of 0.5 volts. As with all modules in the LZX Visionary line, the inputs can therefore receive any type of signal, not just binary logic pulses. There are two boolean functional blocks with 3 inputs and 3 outputs each. The outputs represent the logical AND, OR, and XOR combinations of the 3 input signals. Additionally, there are two inverter functions. The output of these inverters represents the logical inversion of the input signal. Through patching some signals to the inverters before the boolean functions, NAND, NOR, and XNOR logic functions are made possible. Please note that this product is new-old-stock. VIDEO LOGIC does not adhere to the LZX quality standards developed since the introduction of the Expedition series modules. Some zippering on key edges is normal.6HP 60MA +/- 12V (estimated)",

      "description": "Sold Out! The Triple Video Fader & Key Generator (TVFKG) is a versatile signal processing module which includes three separate voltage-controlled crossfaders and three separate voltage comparators (key generators). cascaded input columns and selectable crossfader control source modes allow complex operation for a variety of purposes such as crossfading, multiplication, luma keying, chroma keying, window comparison, simple comparison and amplitude classification. control voltage inputs and bias controls:control voltage (cv) inputs have corresponding level/inversion controls, allowing both addition or subtraction of the input signal from the additional 1v bias controls. once the cv input and bias level are summed, they control the key generator’s comparator threshold. depending on the crossfader control source mode, they may also directly control the corresponding crossfader. faders:signal inputs to a and b channels of the voltage-controlled crossfaders are accessible via the frontpanel. mode switches allow selection of the control voltage source for the crossfaders. the fade mode enables the summed cv & bias voltages to control the crossfader directly. the key mode enables the the corresponding key generator output to control the crossfader directly. the and mode enables a logical and generated from all three key generators to control the crossfader directly. in addition, crossfaders 2 & 3 can select crossfader 1’s control source for use as a master control. crossfader outputs are accessible on the right side of the frontpanel. Voltage-controlled crossfader with two inputs and one output. When control source is at 0 Volt, channel A is completely on. When control source is at 1 Volt, channel B is completely on. Voltage levels between 0 Volt and 1 Volt represent a proportional mix of channels A & B. With signal inserted to channel B only, the fader behaves as a traditional voltage-controlled amplifier. KEY GENERATOR High speed voltage comparator serving as a key generation source. When the key generator input is greater than the voltage represented by the sum of the CV input and bias controls, the key output is 1 Volt (on). Otherwise, the output is 0 Volt (off). Inversion switches select between non-inverted and inverted versions of this logic signal. CONTROL SOURCE Control voltage (CV) inputs are processed by level and inversion controls and then summed with a variable 0 to 1 Volt bias. This sum serves as the threshold level for the key Generator, and as the control source for the fader while in FADE mode.",

      "description": "Ribbons is a 3-bit digitizer module for your EuroRack video synthesizer. Slice your video sources and waveforms into eight discrete bands which invoke the look of primitive digital graphics and video colorizers from the 1970s and 1980s. Implemented with 9 high speed analog comparators and CMOS logic, the digitization technique employed by Ribbons lacks any pixel clock or quantized time base. This reveals a surreal and silky quality to the image under modulation, which we feel is absent from modern digital video. Features Hard edged binary 3-bit ADC and Window Key outputs Positive and negative 3-bit DAC outputs provide stepped analog waveforms Center and Span controls and CV inputs allow modulation of sampling offset and scale Enable and Disable inputs extend utility for masking and compositing in the patch Legacy Our first 3-bit digitizer module was 2012's 8 Stage Video Quantizer & Sequencer, which was loosely inspired by the Amplitude Classifier module from the Sandin Image Processor. In 2018, we released Castle 000 ADC and Castle 001 DAC as part of the Castle DIY module series In 2019, we released Fortress, the first module to integrate ADC and DAC capabilities in the same module.
