        <dt>key</dt>
        <dd>any video signal used to control a transition between two or more other video signals</dd>
        <dt>hard key</dt>
        <dd>a boolean logic signal which switches between two signals.</dd>
        <dt>key generator</dt>
        <dd>a module designed to condition an input for the purpose of keying operations</dd>
        <dt>soft key</dt>
        <dd>an analog voltage representing the mix ratio between two video signals</dd>
        <dt>hard key generator</dt>
        <dd>typically implemented as a differential analog comparator.</dd>
        <dt>soft key generator</dt>
        <dd>typically implemented as a high gain differential amplifier with black and white level clipping</dd>
        <dt>chroma key generator</dt>
        <dd>processes the chroma components (PbPr) of a component video signal, allowing key extraction based on Hue and
          Saturation of the video source</dd>
        <dt>luma key generator</dt>
        <dd>processes the luma component (Y) of a component video signal, allowing key extraction based on the overall
          brightness of the video source</dd>
        <dt>multi level key generator</dt>
        <dd>produces multiple key signals from a single source, and are often used as the frontend for colorizers and
          sequencers</dd>
        <dt>component key generator</dt>
        <dd>acts on one color channel at a time, but still includes the entire colorspace in its output function</dd>
        <dt>window key generator</dt>
        <dd>has dual threshold controls, either Upper/Lower or Span/Center</dd>
        <dt>fader</dt>
        <dd>a module which performs a transition between two video sources. typically it has a direct key input, without
          much local control over the key itself.</dd>
        <dt>keyer</dt>
        <dd>a module which has both a key generator and a fader or switcher</dd>
        <dt>linear colorizer / multi level keyer</dt>
        <dd>combines multiple faders with a multi level key generator function to produce a transition across more than
          two inputs</dd>
