      <h1 class="title">Test &amp; Calibration</h1>

      <p>Many users like to perform regular service and checkups on their analog hardware systems. For many, the ability
        to verify a module is operating properly is useful for troubleshooting a complex system. For others, using
        electronic test equipment like oscilloscopes, multimeters and firmware programmers is part of their relationship
        to the instrument. With this in mind, we present models for both basic functional testing and advanced testing
        and calibration. We would love to see LZX Modular equipment in use several centuries from now, due to the
        diligence and care taken by its community of users.</p>
